1. Create a new Java class named 'Constants.java'

2. Create a private method for 'private Constants() {}'

3. Create a static final class method for each command

4. create a public final static double variable for each constant i.e('public static final double FEEDER_OFF = 0.0;')

5. import the constants file into each command

6. call the constant in each place i.e('Constants.Intake.FEEDER_OFF')

7. test on test bench

8. If extra time is available then we can add our can devices to the constants so they are easily changable

9. we can also add anything else that might need to be changed on a regular basis to a constant
